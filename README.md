# school-class-management

1.Using serialization, save an object in a file obj.txt

2.Repeat the above exercise using inheritance classes

3.Serialize and save a list of objects in one or more files and then return one by request using deserialization 

4.Letâ€™s start working on a Spring Project!

Create a Spring project using Spring Initializr for a school class management

At least 3 classes that are representative for a school class management using inheritance and encapsulation

Create endpoint for adding, updating objects from each class, deleting all and one specific object and returning one or all the saved objects. Use one or more txt files as a storage for your objects.

Create 2 properties files and retrieve the name of the txt files (where the objects will be stored) directly from the yml or properties files, the txt files must be different based on the active profile. Hint: use @Value Spring annotation and run the project using active profiles.

The project needs to contain:
DTO ( putting and getting the objects ), Controllers, Services
